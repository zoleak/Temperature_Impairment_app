# Temperature Impairment App

## Overview 
Temperatures in streams and rivers are influenced by many atmospheric and hydrologic processes affecting the movement of heat. This in turn, enormously impacts the structure
and function of aquatic systems. If not addressed properly, temperature impairments can harm aquatic organisms. 

The purpose of this R shiny app is to better understand the water temperature impairments
                                 throughout New Jersey. This app will make it easier to view and play with the 
                                 data, as well as gain different insight from the data through maps/plots.
